Once you have created your Discord bot, you will need to copy the bot token and paste it into your Node.js application. You can do this by creating a new `.env.local` file in your project root directory and adding the following line:

```markdown
BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
```

Replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE with your actual bot token from the Discord Applications Portal.
